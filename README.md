This repo is a collection of HTML patterns for web forms that I use.
Sample CSS is included.

It is a reference for my other javascript repos that assume these markup patterns.

Inspiration comes from Aaron Gustafson's [Learning to love forms](http://www.webdirections.org/resources/aaron-gustafson/) presentation.

A form is a list of questions!
